Basic Font Information

The +Jakarta Sans is a versatile modern type family designed for +Jakarta City Branding in 2020, where each glyph has its own varieties with its own different characteristics. Like the city itself, the beauty is in the details. The charms of +Jakarta Sans appear when one looks closer, manifesting in a beauty that emerges once seen as a whole. Each alternate on Display family contains several alternates characters, while the text version has a small adjustment to preserve the legibility of small sizes.
